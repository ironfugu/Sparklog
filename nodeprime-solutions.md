# NodePrime Datacenter Solutions

## Virtual Datacenter **Overview**   

NodePrime virtual datacenter is an industry first
application to allow the users to build out a simulated
datacenter in an instant on a laptop that constructs many various
hardware server configurations with an overlaying virtual network.  Once the topology and servers are constructed, then the users can load and test any applications without any actual hardware.

**Key Benefits**   

*  Simulate topology and server configuration  
*  Accelerate testing of applications
*  Accelerate testig of hardware provision, deployment setup



**Use Cases**

## Inventory and Analytics
**Overview**    

NodePrime® delivers is an advanced inventory and analytic platform for heterogeneous, multi-vendor, multi-generational of IT infrastructure, networks and any x86/ARM servers.  It enables IT managers, operators to quickly discover datacenter assets, aggregate the inventory data and present them on an single dashboard to provide quick search, filter to operate datacenter more intelligently.  In addition, it also collect metrics, syslog to help the operator to perform preventative analysis.

**Key Benefits**   

NodePrime boosts datacenter performance by:

* Reduce CapEx: Through discovery of under-performed, under-utilized servers to increase the utilization  
* Reduce OpEx: Through deep inventory analysis of components and OS packages to improve efficiency of the overall systems
* Reduce unplanned outages:  Cross-correlation machine learnings at component level to drive failure prediction and recommendation


**Main Features**  

*  Quick, simple stand-alone deployment - up running in minutes  
*  Advanced operational dashboard with native apps to analyze various aspects of the data center  
*  High data ingested performance datastore  
*  Time stamped of all inventory, sys-logs and metrics data  
*  Comprehensive intelligence on performance, state and reliability  
*  Root cause identification through machine learning
*  Detailed forensic analysis to drive compliance and SLA’s
*  Fully customizable subscriptions and alerts 
*  Full API support



## Deployment and Management 

**Overview**  

NodePrime® platform is an an integrated solution designed to provide a full life cycle management and automation for hyper-scale datacenter.   It enables IT managers, operators to efficiently deploy, provision bare metals from dock to OS ready across heterogeneous hardware.  In addition, it performs many of the today and tomorrow operations in automated fashions at large scale.
